# Dribbble2Flutter

This repo was created to showcase some of my design to code conversions based on visual interpretation of images and GIFs found on dribbble.com
Currently, I have only one design to showcase. Plans are underway to create a few more designs and add them here.

### dribbble_stepper
Based on [Stepper XVIII](https://dribbble.com/shots/5639404-Stepper-XVIII) by [Oleg Frolov](https://dribbble.com/Volorf), this project showcases a fun, clean, springy number picker. Originally designed in Adobe After Effects, this widget is now usable in new or existing Flutter projects. 

More designs coming soon!
